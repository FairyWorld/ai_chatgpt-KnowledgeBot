"Methods: In this study we used Mendelian Randomization (MR) with genetic variants linked to cathepsins as instrumental variables. Summary data from European ancestry genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on Alzheimer's disease (AD) Parkinson's disease (PD) Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) multiple sclerosis (MS) and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) as outcomes. We employed inverse variance-weighted (IVW) MR to assess the causal impact of cathepsins on neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). Various sensitivity analyses were employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the results followed by heterogeneity test. Multivariable MR (MVMR) analysis was utilized to adjust for potential confounding factors. Additionally reverse MR analysis reinforced the findings of the forward MR analysis."

"Results: The MR analysis indicates that elevated cathepsin H levels associate with increased AD and DLB risk. Conversely cathepsin B levels show a negative correlation with PD risk. In a MVMR analysis with nine cathepsins as covariates effect estimates remain unchanged. Only the positive MR result suggests a weaker causal relationship between cathepsin H and ALS risk. Additionally no causal relationship is found between cathepsins and MS. Reverse MR analysis suggests PD and ALS may reduce cathepsin B levels. MS elevates cathepsin E levels DLB negatively correlates with cathepsin Z levels and there's no reverse causal link between AD and cathepsins."

"This study has revealed an increased risk of Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) associated with elevated levels of cathepsin H. Cathepsin H, a member of the cysteine protease family, is found in reactive astrocytes and microglial cells [14]. The overexpression of cathepsin H may be linked to the response to misfolded proteins, attributable to dysfunction in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and contributes to motor neuron degeneration through its association with cellular protein degradation pathways [15]. Consequently, the involvement of cathepsin H in the mechanisms underlying AD and DLB is multifaceted, necessitating further research to elucidate its role in these conditions. Additionally, reverse MR analysis indicates a reduction in the expression of cathepsin Z in DLB. Cathepsin Z, also known as cathepsin X, refers to the same enzyme that was reported independently by two distinct research groups under different names [16, 17]. A recent study suggests that cathepsin X, implicated in neuroinflammation-induced neurodegenerative diseases, represents a potential therapeutic target for such conditions [18]. From a genetic perspective, this study provides valuable insights into the impact of DLB on the expression of cathepsin Z."

"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of dopamine-producing neurons and the aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) [19]. Lysosomes serve as the primary site for degrading aggregated α-syn [20]. It has been reported that the cathepsin B variant rs1293298 is identified as a modifier for the risk and onset age of GBA-associated PD and Lewy body dementia [21]. Recent research findings suggest that the reduction in the functionality of cathepsin B negatively impacts the lysosomal pathway associated with the pathogenesis of PD. Conversely the activation of cathepsin B can facilitate the clearance of pathogenic α-synuclein [22]. In cellular models of PD there is a decrease in the protein or activity levels of cathepsin B [23] [24]. The results of this study support the bidirectional causal relationship between genetically predicted cathepsin B levels and PD. Therefore increasing cathepsin B levels could be a potential therapeutic strategy and cathepsin B holds promise as a biomarker for early PD diagnosis providing valuable assistance in the early detection of PD."

"Additionally our results indicate a weak causal connection between cathepsin H levels and ALS. When adjusting for other types of cathepsins in multivariable analysis no statistically significant differences were found possibly due to compensatory functions in other family members. Multivariable MR analysis may help mitigate potential biases that could influence traditional observational studies [25]. Therefore the current evidence apart from AD and DLB is insufficient to determine a causal relationship between cathepsin H and ALS in this study. We did not find a significant association between cathepsin levels and MS. The results of reverse MR analysis suggest an increase in cathepsin E expression with MS. Previous research has indicated that inhibiting elastase production dependent on cathepsin E might be a potential therapeutic target for alleviating pain in patients with multiple sclerosis [26]. This study may provide valuable insights into the potential mechanisms of MS-related pain and contribute to the research and development of medications for such conditions."
